title: 'The React State Hook'

  'Recently announced at ReactConf 2018, hooks are functions that expose certain
  React features to function components. These features were previously limited
  to classes only. As of writing, hooks are still an experimental proposal in
  React, although they are slated to become official in the v16.7.0 release.
  This post will explain the State Hook in-depth.'

The [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) proposal comes with
some [built-in hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html) that focus
on doing one thing, such as providing state or context to a function component.
You can also use these as building blocks to create
[your own](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html).

In [a recent post](/blog/on-react-hooks), I shared some personal thoughts on the
hooks proposal. This post will be more technical, as I go further into detail on
what I consider to be the most important hook: `useState`.

As of writing this, hooks are still an **experimental proposal**. Nothing in
this post should be considered final. Please keep this in mind. There is
currently an [open RFC](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/68) where you can
stay current on the proposal, and even voice your concerns if you have any.

Hooks are available in `v16.7.0-alpha` of React. I've set up a
[CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/1z16jj9y24) that will get you going
quickly if you want to follow along with the example in this post.

## React state today

If you want a stateful component in React, your only option at the moment is to
write that component as a class. This has been a source of frustration for me.
Often I will find myself spending a good chunk of mental energy contemplating
whether or not I want to refactor a _perfectly acceptable_ function component
into a class merely to hold some state.

I'll convince myself that avoiding such a refactor is in my best interests.
Eventually I'll find myself falling down a rabbit hole of state management
strategies, libraries, and _"other solutions"_.

If things _really_ go south, I'll start asking if the component even _needs_
state in the first place, as if it's something that should be avoided.

It sounds excessive, and you're probably right. But it's happened. And if you've
spent a significant amount of time working with React, you may have found
yourself on this wild goose chase as well (or maybe it's just me 🤔).

## Enter the `useState` hook

With the `useState` hook, function components can now hold local state.

```jsx
import React, {useState} from 'react'

function StreetLight() {
  const [color, setColor] = useState('GREEN')
}
```

`useState` is a function that accepts an initial state and returns an array with
2 items:

1. The current state
2. A function that can be called to update the state

Because of the way array destructuring works, we can name the items returned by
`useState` anything we want. There is no constraint imposed on us by the API. As
a convention, it seems that the React ecosystem is taking to the
`[value, setValue]` syntax.

In the example above, `color` is the state value and is initialized to
`'GREEN'`. The `setColor` function can be called to update that value.

Note that, unlink a class component, state in a function component **does not**
need to be an object. Here it's just a string.

Another important note is that the update function, in this case `setColor`,
does not _merge_ the new state with the current, but instead _overrides_ it
completely. This is different from how `this.setState` works in class
components.

## Updating state

The value of `color` will be preserved between re-renders (more on this below),
_unless_ the `setColor` function is called with a new value:

```jsx
function StreetLight() {
  const [color, setColor] = useState('GREEN')
  const slow = () => setColor('YELLOW')

  return <button onClick={slow}>Slow down!</button>
}
```

When the button is clicked, the function `slow` will call `setColor` with a
value of `'YELLOW'`. This will cause the `StreetLight` component to re-render.
When it does, the `color` variable will be updated to `'YELLOW'`.

### Wait, what?

At first glance, you would think that every time `StreetLight` renders, it calls
`useState` with a value of `'GREEN'`. So how can `color` be anything _but_
green?

A logical question. Here are a few lines from the
[React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html#declaring-a-state-variable)
that may help _ease_ you in to this concept:

> "Normally, variables 'disappear' when the function exits but state variables
> are preserved by React."

> "React will remember its current value between re-renders, and provide the
> most recent one to our function."

> "You might be wondering: why is `useState` not named `createState` instead?
> 'Create' wouldn’t be quite accurate because the state is only created the
> first time our component renders. During the next renders, `useState` gives us
> the current state."

### But how?

> It's not magic, it's JavaScript!

Put simply, React
[keeps track](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#how-does-react-associate-hook-calls-with-components)
of calls to `useState` for each component internally. It will also create a
mapping between the update function and the state value for which it updates.

The initial value passed to `useState` is returned on the first render, but from
there React will return the correct value based on the mapping. It also uses the
map to know which slice of state to mutate when the update function is called.

If this seems confusing to you, you're not alone. I was baffled by how this
could work as well. My confusion only increased when I found out that
[you can have multiple calls](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html#declaring-multiple-state-variables)
to `useState` in the same component:

```jsx
function StreetLight() {
  const [color, setColor] = useState('GREEN')
  const [broken, setBroken] = useState(false)
  // ...
}
```

Yes, you can do this to your heart's content.

## How does React keep track of the state?

In order for all of this to work, React expects that you follow
[a few rules](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html#explanation):

1. Only call hooks at the top level of a function
2. Only call hooks from function components and
   [custom hooks](#writing-a-custom-hook)

React imposes these rules because it
[relies on the call order of hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html#explanation)
to manage data properly. This may seem fickle at first, but these rules aren't
hard to follow. And quite frankly I can't think of a scenario where you'd want
to break them.

In order to internalize how React manages hooks in your components, I _highly_
recommend reading
[this Medium post](https://medium.com/@ryardley/react-hooks-not-magic-just-arrays-cd4f1857236e)
by [Rudi Yardley](https://medium.com/@ryardley). It was crucial in my learning
process. 📚

And here's a

## Wrapping up

I consider `useState` to be a building block. You can use it _as-is_ to provide
state to your function components, or you can use it to abstract stateful logic
out into [custom hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html)!

I believe custom hooks are going to be the biggest superpower React developers
will gain when `v16.7` lands, and `useState` is the foundation. The community is
already sharing some
[awesome stuff](https://github.com/rehooks/awesome-react-hooks) with custom
hooks and this pattern will only grow exponentially.
